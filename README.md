# House-Price-vs-Interest-Rate---Data-Analyst

Historically, there has been an inverse relationship between interest rates and home prices. Conventional economic wisdom stated that when interest rates rose, home prices tended to decrease. This was because higher interest rates increased the cost of home loans and mortgages, reducing the number of buyers who could afford to purchase homes. With decreased demand, home prices would usually drop. 

Conversely, when interest rates fell, the cost of financing for home buyers went down. Lower interest rates allowed more individuals to qualify for affordable mortgages and loans. This increased buyer demand would bid up home prices. So traditionally, low interest rates signaled a hot housing market, while high interest rates cooled it off. 

However, in the last couple of years, this inverse correlation between interest rates and home values has become decoupled. Despite rising inflation driving interest rates higher, home prices have not only remained steady but in many markets they have continued to rise sharply. Several factors help explain this anomalous situation. 

This project will review findings on the interest rate-home price relationship before and after COVID-19 and examine factors (inflation, house inventory, moving trend, labor shortage) that affect house prices in four states (MN, MO, GA) that help explain this apparent deviation from established economic models.
